      <p><strong>Zambia 2016, March 15-17</strong>
(Virtual Event March 15 to June 1)
Big Ideas, Visionaries, Forecasters and Computer Developers Welcome at UNDP Climate Information for a Resilient Africa Event</p>

<p>What’s It All About</p>

<p>Innovation, out-of-the-box-thinking, big ideas, and smart applications of technology have the potential to significantly impact the way weather information is shared across Africa. And in a world where information is power – and climate change is producing more severe storms and temperature fluctuations that affect vulnerable African communities – access to accurate and timely weather forecasts can work toward reducing poverty, empowering rural communities and saving lives.</p>

<p>With the goal of creating an innovation-driven crowd-sourced space for big thinkers and techno-visionaries to come together, the UNDP’s Programme on Climate Information for Resilient Development in Africa (CIRDA) is inviting developers, mobile application gurus, students and developers to this three-day hackathon and innovations incubator.</p>

<p>The Climate Action Hackathon will run in parallel with a multinational UNDP workshop addressing “The Last Mile: Saving lives, improving livelihoods and increasing resiliency with tailored weather information services for a changing climate.”</p>

<p>Participants will have access to leaders in meteorology, technology, sustainable development and communications. They will work individually or in teams to create mobile applications, technology solutions or data-crunching systems that address Africa’s persistent challenges in adapting to climate change, and sharing early warnings and accurate climate information across the continent.</p>

<p>The Climate Action Hackathon Challenge</p>

<p>•    Create prototype mobile and information-system-based applications and technological solutions to share actionable weather and climate information with a variety of stakeholders, sectors and end-users.
•    Connect technology with people to bridge the last mile.
•    Build scalable systems that react to more frequent storms, increase in lightning, erratic weather patterns and long-term climate change.
•    Create technological solutions that are built for Africa and solve local challenges.
•    Design and develop next-generation applications to improve on existing systems and methodologies to use climate information and reach end users.
•    Leverage existing information, networks and human capacity to seed innovation.
•    Communicate existing climate information in an innovative and easy-to-understand manner to catalyze action, improve productivity, save lives and empower end-users.
